# Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains my solution for **Task 5 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** for the Data Analyst Internship.

## 📂 Contents

- `titanic_eda.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with full EDA:
  - data loading and cleaning
  - univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
  - correlation heatmap and pair plots
- `Titanic_EDA_Report_With_All_Charts.pdf` – PDF report with key visualizations and written insights.
- `*.png` – saved plots (univariate, bivariate, multivariate).
- `train.csv`, `test.csv`, `gender_submission.csv` – Titanic Kaggle datasets used for analysis (optional if not required).

## 🔧 Tools Used

- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key Insights (Summary)

- Overall survival rate is around **38%**.
- **Gender** is a strong factor: females have a much higher survival rate than males.
- **Passenger class** matters: 1st class passengers survive more than 2nd and 3rd.
- Higher **fare** (linked to higher class) is positively correlated with survival.
- Children and passengers in **small families (2–4 members)** showed better survival than solo or very large families.

## 📄 Task Reference

This work is based on **Task 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** from the Data Analyst Internship assignment.
